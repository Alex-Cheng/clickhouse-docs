# Why do we have experimental and beta features? {#why-beta-and-experimental}

ClickHouse is an open-source project. It has many users and companies using it for various use cases, you can see our adopters [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/about-us/adopters). Thanks to this wide adoption, it also means that ClickHouse is receiving a lot of contributions, not only from ClickHouse employees but also from the community itself. All these contributions are not developed at the same speed, some features can take a long time to be prototyped and even a longer time to receive enough feedback from the community to be considered generally available (GA). Any new features generally start as experimental, but given they are not developed at the same pace and by various contributors, it can lead to many questions about the future of some of them and when they will become generally available. This is why we decided to introduce Beta features on top of experimental features, the intent is to give better insights on the development of beta features and to help gather more feedback around them by supporting them as a company.


## Beta Features
- These features are actively worked on to make them generally available (GA)
- The main known issues around these features can be tracked in GitHub
- These features and how they work might change in the future
- These features might be enabled by default in our Cloud
- ClickHouse supports beta features


## Experimental Features
- These features might never become GA
- These features and how they work might change in the future
- These features need to be deliberately enabled
- ClickHouse does not support experimental features
- These features may lack functions and documentation
