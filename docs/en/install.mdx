# Installing ClickHouse

You have two options for getting up and running with ClickHouse:

- **[ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/):** the official ClickHouse as a service, - built by, maintained, and supported by the creators of ClickHouse
- **Self-managed ClickHouse:** ClickHouse can run on any Linux, FreeBSD, or Mac OS X with x86_64, AArch64, or PowerPC64LE CPU architecture

## ClickHouse Cloud

The quickest and easiest way to get up and running with ClickHouse is to create a new service in [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud/):

<div class="eighty-percent">

![Create a ClickHouse Cloud Service](@site/docs/en/_snippets/images/createservice1.png)
</div>

Once your Cloud service is provisioned, you will be able to [connect to it](./integrations/connect-a-client.md) and start [inserting data](./integrations/data-ingestion.md).

:::note
The [Quick Start](/docs/en/quick-start.mdx) walks through the steps to get a ClickHouse Cloud service up and running, connecting to it, and inserting data.
