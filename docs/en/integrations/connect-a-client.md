ClickHouse has several options for connecting to it (depending on what you are trying to accomplish), including:

- The **Play UI** is handy for running the occasional SQL query
- The [**clickhouse-client**](clickhouse-client-local.md) is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to run multiple commands in a session from your favorite terminal application
- [**clickhouse-local**](clickhouse-client-local.md) opens up the world of ClickHouse features and functions without requiring a connection to a running ClickHouse service

If you are looking to connect a BI tool like Grafana, Tableau and others, check out the [Visualize category](./data-visualization/) of the docs.
